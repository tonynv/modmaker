Useful tools and ideas typically emerge from three powerful catalysts: 

**Need** identifies real problems requiring solutions, creating clear direction for innovation.

**Passion** provides the emotional energy and persistence to overcome obstacles and bring ideas to completion.

**Annoyance** creates visceral motivation to eliminate frustrations, often revealing genuine user experience problems worth solving.

I remember clearly when you guys were discussing this CLI engine.  While fully understanding the annoyance of wiring in CLI flags, I remember thinking, “What does this have to do with this project? Can’t we  just use argparse and get back to working on the features?”  And when I saw the PR come in, I was, “Yeah, right. That’s not gonna work well. Let me take a look at this.” And then I fell in love with it and felt instantly humbled.  And to that note, I would like to bravo!. Because I have used this pattern in many projects, so thank you.
